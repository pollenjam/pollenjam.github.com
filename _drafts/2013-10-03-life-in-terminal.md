This course is a command line trick fest and script share, covering set up, workflow enhancements, ssh, networking, compiling, editing, version control, window themes/aesthetics, and more. 

If you have specific questions about using the command line, this is the class to ask them. 

As far as languages, we'll touch on Bash, SED, Regular Expressions, and other scripting languages.

*Prerequisites:* A computer with a 'nix-flavor OS. Could be anything from a Macbook, to a Raspberry PI. If you have Windows installed, you'll need [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/). We also have some machines kicking around if you want to borrow one.
