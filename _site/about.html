            <h2>About</h2>

<p>Computers and coding are featured extensively in our creative and professional practices; be it play, work, art, or education. Our workshops are hosted out of our shared studio on in San Francisco, CA, affectionately dubbed ShinyLab. We are extremeley interested in how to use computing as a creative tool, and developed these workshops to allow a space for a highly focused group to come together and learn in a studio environment.</p>

<p>&quot;Pollenjam&quot; describes an environment where a group gets together to jam/crosspollenate on a subject they&#39;re passionate about. It&#39;s a bit like the dance that a honey bee does to show its hive where the flowers are, but this dance is done with code. </p>

<p>Our structure was inspired by the model used by <a href="http://kitchentablecoders.com">KitchenTableCoders</a> in Brooklyn, NY. </p>
