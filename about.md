## About

Computers and coding are featured extensively in our creative and professional practices; be it play, work, art, or education. Our workshops are hosted out of our shared studio on in San Francisco, CA, affectionately dubbed ShinyLab. We are extremeley interested in how to use computing as a creative tool, and developed these workshops to allow a space for a highly focused group to come together and learn in a studio environment.

"Pollenjam" describes an environment where a group gets together to jam/crosspollenate on a subject they're passionate about. It's a bit like the dance that a honey bee does to show its hive where the flowers are, but this dance is done with code. 

Our structure was inspired by the model used by [KitchenTableCoders](http://kitchentablecoders.com) in Brooklyn, NY.
