## About

We host workshops in our studio in SF.

We're interested in computational literacy, education, diversity, and creative practice. 

"Pollenjam" describes an environment where a group gets together to jam/crosspollenate on a subject they're passionate about.

Our structure was inspired by [KitchenTableCoders](http://kitchentablecoders.com) in Brooklyn, NY.
