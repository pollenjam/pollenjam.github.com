Our first PollenJam! What better subject to start with than the Shell? This is fundamental Terminal trick fest and script share, covering everything from aesthetics, to set up, to workflow enhancements, ssh, networking, compiling, editing, version control, and more. If you have specific questions about using the command line, this is the class to ask them. 

As far as languages, we'll touch on Bash, SED, Regular Expressions, and other scripting languages.

Everything will be compiled and open-sourced on github. 

*Prerequisites:* A computer with a 'nix-flavor OS. Could be anything from a Macbook, to a Raspberry PI. If you have Windows installed, you'll need [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/). We also have some machines kicking around if you want to borrow one.
