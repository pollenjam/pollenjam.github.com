This course is a command line trick fest and script share, covering set up, workflow enhancements, ssh, networking, compiling, editing, version control, window themes/aesthetics, and more. We'll touch bash, SED, Regular Expressions, and more.

If you have specific questions about using the command line, this is the place to ask them. 

*Prerequisites:* A computer with a 'nix-flavor OS. Could be anything from a Macbook, to a Raspberry PI. If you have Windows installed, install [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) beforehand.
